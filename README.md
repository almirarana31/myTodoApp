# Welcome to Ally's To Do List App ‚ù§Ô∏è
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple to-do application built with React and Firebase, with support for Docker deployment.

## Let's get started! ‚ú®
You can set up this project using GitHub (manual installation) or Docker (containerized setup).

### üê≥ Setup via Docker (Containerized Deployment)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the docker image from the repository
```
docker pull alfarana/my-todo-app
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 alfarana/my-todo-app
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the app<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.<br/><br/>


### üîß Setup via GitHub (Manual Installation)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the GitHub Repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-todo-app.git
```
```
cd my-todo-app
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node Dependencies
```
npm install
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up Firebase/Firestore
1. Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.
2. Copy your Firebase config and update firebase.js like so:

```
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google Sign-In).
4. Create a Firestore Database.
5. Add two collections named "tasks" and "users".
6. In the "Rules" tab, update your rules to look like this:

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 4, 16);
    }
  }
}
```


4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App
```
npm start #Runs on localhost:3000
```
