# Welcome to Ally's To Do List App ‚ù§Ô∏è
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple to-do application built with React and Firebase, with support for Docker deployment.

```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 alfarana/my-todo-app
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the app<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.<br/><br/>


### üîß Setup via GitHub (Manual Installation)

4. Copy your Firebase config and update firebase.js

```
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```
